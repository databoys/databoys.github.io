title: Using and improving our neural network (96% MNIST)
published: false

Now that we have created our artisan handcrafted neural network we should improve it with some modern techniques that a bunch of really smart people discovered. When I was making these improvements I used the kaggle competition on the MNIST dataset as my benchmark. That way I could compare my neural net performance to that of other peoples neural networks. I could also check my scores against other tried and true methods listed ['here'](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). The original neural network that I created for the last post got 86% on the full MNIST dataset and the new one with the improvements that I will go over here got 96%. Which is right in line with the benchmarks on LeCun's website that I linked earlier. Which I am very happy about!
